# Week 5

Tasks
- [X] Compare and contrast various clustering algorithms.
  - Visualizing the output of clustering algorithms on all possible permutations of variable pairs.
  - Interpreting the output of the clustering algorithms.
      

Issues: 
 
- Affinity Propagation's execution time was too long even while being applied on one pair of variables. Optimized the code to remedy this.
- To facilitate viewing the output for the following clustering algorithms, 
  - [BIRCH](../notebooks/BIRCH_Clustering_Output/)
  - [DBSCAN](../notebooks/DBSCAN_Clustering_Output/)
  - [OPTICS](../notebooks/OPTICS_Clustering_Output/)
 
 separate folders have been created with each html file showing the corresponding graph for each permutation of variable pairs.
