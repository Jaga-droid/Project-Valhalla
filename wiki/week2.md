# Week 2

Tasks

- [x] Searching and discussing the various types of datasets available

- [x] Assessing the suitability of the different available datasets for the coursework objectives

- [x] Choosing most suitable dataset: selected the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) available datasets

- >        -chose two datasets, namely; SIMD 2016 and SIMD 2020

- [x] Gathered all available data for SIMD 2016 and 2020

- [x] Posted the following datasets

- >       - [SIMD 2016 dataset](../data/SIMD_2016_Data.xlsx)
- >       - [SIMD 2016 Indicator descriptions dataset](../data/SIMD_2016_Indicator_descriptions.xlsx)
- >       - [SIMD 2016 Contents and Notes dataset](../data/SIMD_2016_Contents & Notes.xlsx)
- >       - [SIMD 2020 Data dataset](../data/SIMD_2020_Data.csv)


Issues:
 [X] Errors identified in the SIMD_2020 dataset
 [X] Blanks in the SIMD_2016 and SIMD_2020 dataset
 [X] There is numeric data in the categorical columns
 [X] Feature names do not match between comparison datasets
 [X] Some columns are missing between the two datasets

Next steps:
 [X] Compare columns between the 2016 and 2020 datasets and remove the uncommon columns
 [X] Match common columns between 2016 and 2020 dataset
 [X] Once the columns between the two datasets are matched, change the column names to exact match (to the same feature name)
 [X] Clean the dataset, handle the blanks and erroneous data in respective columns
